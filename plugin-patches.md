# VRCNext Patches

[← Back to index](./)

Source: [vrcnext-patches-plugin](https://github.com/vrcnext-plugins/vrcnext-patches-plugin)

Small things VRCNext does not do, done from the page. Each patch is independent and off until
you switch it on; disabling the plugin puts everything back.

## Media library folders

VRCNext reveals one photo at a time, from the right-click menu on it. There is no way to open
the folders the library is scanned from. This adds a button per root — the VRChat picture
directory and any watch folders — under Settings → VRCNext Patches.

## Unattended sign-in

When VRChat drops the session, VRCNext clears both saved cookies, **including the
`twoFactorAuth` one** — the very thing that would let the next sign-in skip the authenticator
code — and then hands the page the saved username and password so the login form can fill
itself in. Every re-login therefore costs a button press and a fresh code. On a connection whose
address changes daily, that is a daily chore.

None of that can be fixed from a plugin: the cookie jar lives in the VRCNext backend. What a
plugin can do is press the button and type the code.

- The password is **never stored here**. VRCNext hands it over on `vrcPrefillLogin`, from its
  own encrypted store, each time it is needed.
- Only a TOTP ("authenticator app") prompt can be answered. An emailed code is left to you.
- After a configurable number of consecutive failures the patch switches itself off for the
  session, because VRChat locks an account that is fed bad codes.
- It reacts only to an *expired* session. VRCNext does not prefill after a deliberate logout, so
  this cannot fight you while you switch accounts.

### The secret is stored in plain text

Plugin settings live in `~/.vrcnext-plugins/state.json`, unencrypted, and every plugin in the
page can read it. Anyone holding that file has permanent access to the account, and an
authenticator secret cannot be rotated as easily as a password. Only turn this on for an account
where that is an acceptable trade.

A `secrets` service in the VRCNext Bridge, backed by the freedesktop Secret Service (KWallet,
GNOME Keyring), would keep the secret out of the page entirely — the plugin would ask for a
*code* and never see the seed. Until that exists, the warning above stands.

## Permissions

`host:actions` and `host:events`, each narrowed to an exact list in `plugin.json`:
`revealInExplorer`, `scanLibrary`, `openShortcutFolder`, `vrcLogin`, `vrc2FA` and the events
that answer them. No network access, no VRChat API access, no game log.

## Installing

In VRCNext, **Settings → Plugins → Install a plugin**, with the repository URL:

```
https://github.com/vrcnext-plugins/vrcnext-patches-plugin
```

The [bridge](native-companion.md) clones it, checks the manifest, the [source policy](source-policy.md) and the [signature](signing.md), asks you to confirm on the desktop, and rebuilds.

Every release is signed by this key; check it against the one VRCNext shows when it asks whether to trust a new key, and if an update ever says the key changed, stop and ask before confirming:

```
1bc6-e13e-c44c-3bd0-f5a8-5618-8b9b-919c
```
